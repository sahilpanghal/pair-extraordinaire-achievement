# Pair Extraordinaire Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pair Extraordinaire project! This initiative aims to help beginner programmers gain recognition in the open-source community by earning the "Pair Extraordinaire" achievement. By contributing to this project, you'll learn the ins and outs of GitHub collaboration.

## How to Get the Achievement

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository that you can modify.

### Step 2: Add Your Email

Navigate to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file in your forked repository. Edit the file to add your primary email used on GitHub in the format:

- Your Name <email@example.com>

(NOTE: You need to use your PRIMARY email address which you can see in the Github account settings, otherwise it won't work!!)

### Step 3: Submit a Pull Request

After adding your email, submit a pull request to the original repository. This request will be reviewed, and if everything is correct, it will be merged.

### Step 4: Become a Co-Author

Once your pull request is merged, I will add you  as a co-author to the commit, marking your contribution to the project.
And that's it! Shortly after you should get the achievement in your profile! :D
